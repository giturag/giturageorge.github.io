## Why I Built this Lab
I decided to set up a kali Machine and a VPN to access **HackTheBox** machines to learn more about cybersecurity.

### The Setup
1: VirtualBox running on windows 11 host
2: Kali 2025 Virtualbox machine
3: HackTheBox Account
4: Downloaded a VPN file from HackTheBox

### Lessons Learned
1: How to configure VM settings for optimization of resources.
2: Starting a VPN connection using OpenVPN and changing the region for anew VPN file if the connection fails.
